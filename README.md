# Objective
The object of this capstone project is to use time series to analyze and predict electric energy consumption.

# Motivation
Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values. It's useful to help energy companies predict about when a peak of energy use will come.

# Data Set
https://www.kaggle.com/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption

In this project, the data is from American Electric Power (AEP), a major investor-owned electric utility in the United States of America, delivering electricity to more than five million customers in 11 states. The dataset contains electric energy use from 2004 to 2018 hourly.

# Things to Do
1. Indexing with Time Series Data
2. Visualizing energy consumption time series data
3. Check stationarity
4. If not stationarity, first-differecing
5. Fitting the ARIMA model
6. Forecast
